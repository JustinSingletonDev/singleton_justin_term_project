This is a full Vue project utilizing the VUE CDN. This is a Video 
Game news/article website. With a home, about, multiple articles, and a SignUp page. This was all done using the the Vue Router.

My CSS is also responsive, utilizing Grid, with a navbar that 
compresses into a hamburger on smaller screens. This is 
accomplished using media queries and JavaScript.

The Signup utilized original DOM errors for validation, including 
a sophisticated email validator. Upon a successful signup, a new 
DOM element of your name will be populated.
