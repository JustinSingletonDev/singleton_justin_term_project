                    <p><div class="a">Dead by Daylight is an asymmetrical
                        online horror game. The gameplay is a 4 v 1 survival, 
                        where one side, the survivors, attempt to 
                        repair generators to escape through the exit gate. 
                        The other side of the game is the killer, where you 
                        hunt down the other team of survivors to sacrifice 
                        them to the entity.
                    </p>
                    <p><div class="a">The game is entirely online, but 
                        new players will be able to learn quicly using the 
                        fully comprehensive offline tutorial. There you can

                        running, hiding, and eventually surviving. You can also 
                        learn the basics of killer. This way during your first

                    <p><div class="a">The best thing about Dead by Daylight 
                        is its roster of killers, which includes big names like 
                        Michael Myers, Freddy Krueger, and Leatherface.If horror 
                        and competitive multiplayer is your thing, you must try 
                        this game out.
