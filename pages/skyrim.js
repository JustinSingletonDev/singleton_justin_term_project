                    <p><div class="a">Skyrim was first released on November 
                        11th, 2011. This day was quite momentous for the 
                        gaming community and was met with great love and 
                        admiration. Through the years, Skyrim has been 
                        re-released on newer consoles, including Switch, 
                        and has some newer features.
                    </p>
                    <p><div class="a">With the new console Xbox Series X, 
                        we've put together some of the new changes that gives 
                        this 10 year old game new life. One of the bigger 
                        changes was the addition of mods for the console. 
                        The console version can only handle so much, but 
                        you can change graphics, weather, lighting, new 
                        starting areas, and even brand new story lines to 
                        explore.
                    </p>
                    <p><div class="a">Including this, the newer console 
                        versions allow faster framerates, higher 4k 
                        resolution, and better rendering. All this together 
                        can allow an old Skyrim fan a completely new and 
                        different experience.
