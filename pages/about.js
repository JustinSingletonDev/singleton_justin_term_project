                    <h2>We are a hard-working team of one person!</h2>

                    <p><div class="a">I was born in Honolulu, HI to my Dad Timothy and Mom Hilary. My 
                        Dad was in the Air Force, but soon after I was born, decided to 
                        become a Lutheran Pastor. Funny enough, we still moved around a 
                        lot. We lived in California, Montana, Colorado, and Wisconsin. 
                        I eventually had a brother named Nicholas, and a sister named 
                        Grace.
                    </p>

                    <p><div class="a">I like to say that I'm from Colorado since I lived the most of 
                        my formative years there, but I graduated High School in 
                        Wisconsin. The photo of the gaming system above represents my 
                        love of video games that began early. We didn't get a system 
                        until I was a bit older, so my first console was the PS1 playing 
                        games like Crash Bandicoot and Harry Potter.
