                    <p><div class="a">If you're like me, horror games 
                        are some of the best in gaming, but it can be 
                        daunting to start a new one. With the release 
                        the newest game to the Resident Evil franchise 
                        we've put together a quick starting guide for 
                        anyone who is looking to pick this up.
                    </p>
                    <p><div class="a">As soon as you enter the title 
                        screen start menu, you'll notice three 
                        difficulties. Unlike previous titles, Resident 
                        Evil 8 leans more into the shooting style of 
                        gameplay. For this reason, if you are not too 
                        good at shooters, we recommend the lowest 
                        setting.
                    </p>
                    <p><div class="a">From here, you'll start out 
                        in a cutscene that follows the end events of 
                        Resident Evil 7 about 3 years later. You'll 
                        then be able to learn the basic controls and 
                        quickly be sent into the fantastic narrative 
                        this game has to offer.

                    <p><div class="a">Don't be afraid, the scares in 
                        this game come at a slow incline, but you 
                        will be well prepared before having to defend 
                        yourself. Good luck!
